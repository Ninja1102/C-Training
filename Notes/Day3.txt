Collections

Generic class - Parameterized class

Generic Collection --> same type of data - List<T>, Dictionary<>
Non-Generic collection --> can have Different type of data --> ArrayList

Drawback of ArrayList --> too much conversions (any type to obj & vice versa)

List is preferred alternative of arraylist --> it allows duplicates
HashSet cannot have duplicate values

Boxing (Convert any type(value type) to object type(reference type)) and Unboxing (convert object(reference type) to any type(value type))

ArrayList --> we can add items dynamically
Array --> Defined - same type of data

var - implicitly typed variable

object initialiser (without creating class constructor)

Object created without giving name is known as anonymous object

Collection capacity is 4 in the beginning

In Dictionary --> duplicate key is not allowed but duplicate values are allowed
ContainsKey --> checks whether the key is already present or not



Why files? To store data / information / text to be saved on a file
FileStream object path
FileName - Data.txt

FullPath - path+filename  "../../../File1.txt" --> forward slash


Verbatim String ---->  @"..\..\..\File1.txt" --> we can use backward slash by add @ before the filepath 
------> @ will tell the code that "\" is not an escape sequence


FileStream is a low level object - write byte by byte to the file

Text writing

char - 2byte

StreamWriter is using FileStream down the line


Serialization and deserailization
