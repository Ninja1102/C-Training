.NET is a framework
SDK - design time/ developing code - built in classes
run time - CLR - Common Language Runtime


svm --> to create void main structure in code snippet


CLR provides memory/ clears the memory after run

Source code - Complied code
.cs		.exe(Assembly file)
sol/project/bin/debug/.exe

Project - Console, Windows, Web, Testing...
Run will automatically compile/build the project

Pascal case - start with capital - (Employee)
classname, method name etc..

Camel case - start with lower case - variable, object - (employee)

Datatypes - Value types (Primitive types) and Reference Types (Objects)
Value types - int, float, double, Boolean etc - Stack
Reference - String, Array, Objects - Heap



Entry from console
Console.readLine();
Console.writeLine();
Console.write();



GetLength(0) --> 0 inidicates dimension. in 2d arrays the size can be e.g., (3,4). GetLength(0) takes the value 0 and GetLength(1) takes value as 4.




STRING METHODS
split('') --> to split the entry based on some characters
join() --> will join the entry
IndexOf --> finds the index of the given character where it occurs "first"



'var' is a keyword in .net used when we aren't sure about the datatype - (e.g., var d = 10/5) var will hold 'int' as datatype here


 

in .net struct will also have constructor, thats why we can use new "keyword" for int.
int[] arr1 = new int[5]; --> will create array of 5 objects since it is integer array it will have default value as 0.
int[] arr2 = {1,2,3,4,5} --> direct initialisation


GIT

create a private project in gitLab
share it with trainer as reporter
clone the repo - git clone {httpsURL}
add some files - git status / git add . / git status
commit new changes - git commit -m "changed on 18Aug"
git push -u origin main
